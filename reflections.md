Upon the creation of ‘_Quintessential Getaway_’, I was able to use various new tools in many different applications. Prior to this class, I have only ever stumbled across GitHub to view other people's code to help me figure out some programming of my own. I never actually signed up for a Git Hub account or even knew about the Git Bash terminal. Luckily, I was able to use UNIX for similar commands years ago in an intro level computational analysis class in the Swanson engineering school. It has been quite some time since I had used these commands, so being able to pick them back up and really master the Git command line definitely was a highlight for me in this project. I also feel like many of the projects I have worked on so far in college may have lacked some of the creativity that I was able to unleash in this specific project. Being in engineering school, I find that many times the projects that I am assigned have specific requirements that will guide me towards a definitive solution. This project did not have a **DEFINITIVE** outcome. Everyone’s project is ultimately different in the end because we are all given just baseline criteria. It is past this baseline criterion where mastering the audacity program and applying this unleashed creativity can really be prevalent. I believe that because of all of these ideas in mind, I have really taken advantage of this creative environment and pushed my project past baseline criteria.

Towards the beginning of this project, as seen in the screenshot above, I only started with a few sounds: seagulls chirping, the ocean crashing, a keyboard clicking, and a couple others. Both the seagulls and the ocean wave sounds were able to be sourced from <a href="freesound.org">freesound.org</a>, because I was obviously unable to visit any of the more "local" beaches during this time of the year and I certainly can not afford to fly out right now (haha). I became very fond of this website, but I did not want to let other people's sounds dominate the entirety of my project. I originally wanted to create a familiar feeling for the listener to experience when listening to my soundscape. All of us have most likely been to the beach, but there are many reasons to how and why someone went to the beach in the first place. Since we all are in this class together, and at this university together, who else would not mind escaping to the beach right now if given the opportunity? At this point, I did not know exactly where I wanted to end up, but I did know what moods I wanted to portray. 

This led to my character (me) participating in a zoom lecture, accompanied by a series of nonsensical conversations, to be driven to want to do something more exciting right at beginning of the project. For this sound of nonsensical conversation, I overlayed a few tracks of the dialogue used in the latter of the soundscape and reversed it. To me, it sounds like different conversations being held, but I will never know what is being said and I do not have to know. From here, I did not know exactly how to transition from this environment to the beach environment and I feel like it could have been done in many different ways. I was not entirely sure how to create a cohesive story in the 5-minute criteria assigned. It was here that I knew I needed to create a script or at least a map of how I wanted the story to progress. I eventually made a list of features I wanted to include in the project. This is really where my organization developed for the project, and I am not usually very organized. When this level of organization was combined with the awesome version control software provided by Git, I was ready to move forward with my project. In my repo, I opened up a new markdown file titled _"SCREENSHOTS.md”_. This file was a working log for me to update and narrow down my focus during some of my studio sessions. I got into the habit of committing any changes every time I made an update to any of the files in that repository for the first full draft.

Naturally, my scenes would have to incorporate multiple tracks overlapping each other to really aid in the mental image of what was happening. On a beach, you are not just hearing the ocean, you are hearing a culmination of waves crashing, the seagulls chirping, people laughing, and much more. After further listening to my project, I knew I needed to fill in some “voids” or spaces where there should be a variety of sounds meshing together. Something as simple as adding a song from the <a href="https://freemusicarchive.org/">Free Music Archive</a> allowed me to create a more bar-like environment that I arrive at as soon as I get to the beach in my soundscape. Then I got even more tedious and sensitive to sounds that should not be in my project. I was recording all of my sounds with my iPhone, which tended to pick up a lot of background noise. I ended up deleting a lot of this noise and further mastering individual soundtracks with the noise reduction tool in audacity. This helped me get rid of some of these noises, but I could not get rid of some humming that occurred in my zoom scene. By adding the rain soundtrack to this scene, these humming noises were no longer detectable to the unaided ear. It also added to the mundane and quite dreary mood that I was going for at the beginning of this track. My favorite tools included in this audacity program ended up being the fade in and fade out tools. These features propelled my project into the fluid and cohesive track that is now heard. It allowed me to transition from scene to scene much more effectively and even created an auditory illusion of movement. The louder something is in my project, the closer the character may be to the source. This can really be seen as you approach the beach party after the bar scene. 

The feedback provided from my classmates confirmed that my project was heard as it was intended to be. However, it also opened my eyes up to one specific flaw that I completely overlooked.

Due to the limited availability of my friends, I was only able to get my girlfriend to record the voices of other characters in my story. At this point, the bartender was ‘the same’ person as the character I was interacting with at the beginning of the track. I was able to change the pitch of her voice to make it sound like a different character was used for the bartender.

Overall, I am very happy with how my _'Quintessential Getaway'_ turned out. When I listen to it, I tend to close my eyes and play a mental video in my head to go alongside it. The scenes I have created should be familiar to many of us, so I am hoping that other listeners get the same experience that I do while listening.  Learning the process of editing different sounds and creating sounds like a Foley artist proved to be really fun!
