I feel like I was able to create a cohesive soundscape during this studio session. I had fun stitching together each of my sounds to increase the fluidity of the overall project. I really took use of the "fade in" and "fade out" tools to create a sense of walking through different areas in my soundscape. I also found two songs from the <a href="https://freemusicarchive.org/search">Free Music Archive</a> that really fit well in different places of my project. From here I will continue to update my ASSETS.md and README.md file so they will be ready for class on Tuesday.

From the time I recently left off on my project to now, I actually created more of a script to follow in my project. My girlfriend and I recorded some dialogue to add to the soundscape and contribute to two of the "scenes" that will be in my final project. I have been tweaking how my transitions sound to make them more cohesive and less abrupt. This is one part of the project that I need to keep tweaking for the final draft.

I am currently engaged in further editing. I now added a "zoom session" to add to the mundane tasks that will eventually prompt me to want to go to the beach. I am thinking of using my girlfriend as a co-star in this production. I have found it a little difficult to formulate a cohesive story currently (I plan on making a script to fix this problem). Originally I thought that I could develop my soundscape piece by piece, but I now think that this process may be too difficult. At this point I also updated ASSETS.md with appropriate credit to myself for my recordings.

At this point in my project I began to record some of the sounds that I will be using in the full draft. The introduction to my project will be a student (me) on the computer participating in a boring zoom class. All of the classes are catching up to the student and they are beginning to feel overwhelmed. Luckily, on this day it is a Friday. The student gains some inspiration to treat themselves to a "Quintessential Getaway". They will be entering a vehicle and driving to the beach from this point on. I am still not sure how to signal that they decide to go to the beach, but as I continue digging into the project I may find a way to do this. I recorded all of the sounds from the Voice Memo app on my iPhone. When I originally tried to insert them into audacity I received this error:

Eventually after looking online, I found a way to convert from the standard Apple .m4a sound file to .wav using itunes from this

video.

In the latest version of my soundscape project, I have developed the baseline of my narrative. The first thing that I had to do was figure out a name for the project. Since the theme of my project is about the beach, I obviously wanted something that was along the lines of a vacation. Some trips we take to the beach can be quite spontaneous. I ultimately ended up at the name "Quintessential Getaway". This is one of those vacations where you just really needed to get away for a weekend or so. I believe that all of these sounds used thus far were sourced from <a href="https://freesound.org/">freesound.org</a>. Obviously one of the first sounds that I needed to find was the waves crashing down on the shore. I was able to find a very consistent and delicate sound that aligned with the tranquility theme of my soundscape. The next sound I found was the sound of seagulls chirping about in a flock. To add some depth to my project I wanted to incorporate a group of people coming onto the beach. These people would be the louder group of people that are drinking and playing EDM on a large boombox. I did not want these people to sound like they were right next to where I was on the beach. The sound for the boombox I found was quite muffled and distorted. I also was able to find a sound for a group of people outside drinking and laughing (which was perfect). Eventually I would like to add the sounds of unpacking my car and walking across the beach. When I find the right spot on the beach I will be unfolding my towel and applying sunscreen. Also, I really want a Tiki bar scene where I can go up and order a pina colada.
